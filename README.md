# Advanced_ML_project

This project is the final assignment for the Advanced Machine Learning course in my Master's program. It uses a dataset of California housing prices, which was downloaded from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a model that predicts housing prices based on various features of the dataset.
